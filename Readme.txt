The 4 Python files should be placed in a directory with the .csv files in a folder called 'metadata'.
The data files are not included in the zip file due to file size limitations of moodle.

-FMA.py
-LSH.py
-main.py
-MusicSearch.py
-metadata/
    features.csv
    tracks.csv

To run it with the hyperparameters used for the final results, simply execute the 'main.py' file in 
the command line or a Python IDE of your choice.
